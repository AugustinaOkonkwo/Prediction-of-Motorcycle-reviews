# Company Background
EMO is a manufacturer of motorcycles. The company successfully launched its first electric moped in India in 2019. The product team knows how valuable owner reviews are in making improvements to their mopeds. 

Unfortunately they often get reviews from people who never owned the moped. They donâ€™t want to consider this feedback, so would like to find a way to identify reviews from these people. They have obtained data from other mopeds, where they know if the reviewer owned the moped or not. They think this is equivalent to their own reviews.   


## Customer Question
- Can you predict which reviews come from people who have never owned the moped before?
